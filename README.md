# Bank-ATM-System

## Author
Abdul-Aziz Nassor

## Description
A bank ATM system created in C++ that allows users to log in and use the ATM using their credit card, and can use banking services such as withdrawing cash, depositing cash into the account, and checking transaction history. It has a security system that checks the credit card's pin before letting the user use any banking services on it. It also logs every transaction done on the account for security purposes. Finally, this system allows multiple credit cards to be linked to the user.

## Installation
Go onto Github, find the project and clone the repository.
Afterwards, open bash, locate the destinated file with 'cd', and use git clone on the cloned repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aanassor1/Bank-ATM-System.git
